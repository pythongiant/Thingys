                        The show follows the mysterious alien known as The Doctor who travels throughout time and space in his ship known as the TARDIS with companions, most commonly Earthlings, whom he picks up on his travels. He regularly faces all kinds of aliens and enemies, whom he prefers to outwit rather than use violence against. Throughout its run, Doctor Who has always been notable for producing some of the most inventive and frightening monsters and villains ever shown on the small screen.
