                <div> <p class="description"> Doctor Who is a British television science fiction programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called "the Doctor", an extraterrestrial being, to all appearances human, from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes while working to save civilisations and help people in need</p>

                        The show follows the mysterious alien known as “The Doctor,” who travels throughout time and space in his ship known as the TARDIS with companions, most commonly Earthlings, whom he picks up on his travels. He regularly faces all kinds of aliens and enemies, whom he prefers to outwit rather than use violence against. Throughout its run, Doctor Who has always been notable for producing some of the most inventive and frightening monsters and villains ever shown on the small screen.

                        In the long-running BBC television science fiction programme Doctor Who and related works, the term "companion" refers to a character who travels with, or shares the adventures of the Doctor. In most Doctor Who stories, the primary companion acts as an audience surrogate.</p>
